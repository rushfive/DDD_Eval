Values shouldnt have public setters
	- HOWEVER, they SHOULD have empty internal constructors
	  along with internal setters.
	  This is b/c we still need to query databases and be able
	  to construct these.
	- it's possible that validation rules (in the main constructor)
	  could change over time + we decide we dont need to update existing values.
	  So, without the empty internal constructor, we wouldn't be able to construct this.
